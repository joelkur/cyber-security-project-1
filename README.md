# cyber-security-project-1

A TODO app with security flaws.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository with `git clone https://github.com/joelkur/cyber-security-project-1.git`
2. In the project root folder, run migrations with `python3 manage.py migrate`
3. Create test data with `python3 manage.py initdatabase`
4. Run the server with `python3 manage.py runserver`
5. The project should be running at http://localhost:8000

### Test users
The `initdatabase` command creates the following users:

- admin:admin
- user1:user1
- user2:user2

## Flaws

### Flaw 1: [Cryptographic Failure](https://owasp.org/Top10/A02_2021-Cryptographic_Failures/)
Link to flaw: [/todoapp/models.py#L11](/todoapp/models.py#L11)

Currently raw passwords are stored in database unencrypted. This is not ideal as the passwords of all users might potentially be leaked if the site gets hacked.

A simple fix for this could be using Django's built-in password management for hashing and other password related logic. Since the `User` model class is extended from `AbstractUser`, which already has password hashing functionality, the `set_password` and `check_password` methods could simply be removed in `User` model.
